# Codility Lessons

[![CI](https://github.com/tioback/codility-lessons/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/tioback/codility-lessons/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

I enjoy tackling problems that require algorithmic thinking. 

I often supplement my learning on sites like [Codility](https://www.codility.com), [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com), and [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com) to explore new ways to solve problems.

This repository records how I use [Codility's Lessons](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons) to develop my algorithmic thinking by consulting docs and interacting with AI. For each problem I compare alternative methods with my initial solution, refine them if needed, and present a final solution.

This is not a scientifically rigorous method. The content of this repository reflects my personal musings and leverages AI for architectural review and peer-like feedback, similar to what you might expect from a team.

Each lesson will consist of:

1. Initial solution — my first implementation
2. Test data — inputs and expected outputs
3. AI chat log — notes from conversations with AI
4. Improved solution — refinements
5. What I learned — lessons and insights
6. References

I'll do my best to credit original authors for algorithms or ideas; apologies for any oversights and please open an issue or submit a PR so I can fix them and add the proper attribution.
